## III. DevBlog: Chronological Archive

### [2026-01-21] Chapter 4: Multi-Character Synthesis & Industrial Expansion

The platform has achieved a critical milestone in multi-character interoperability and industrial analysis.
- **Contextual API Sovereignty:** Integrated `user_id` context propagation via Axios interceptors. Backend telemetry is now strictly scoped to the active character profile without cross-contamination.
- **State Synchronicity (Atomic Re-sync):** Enhanced Zustand stores (`auth`, `character`, `financial`) with atomic `clearData` operations and automated re-fetching triggers.
- **Mining Intelligence Deployment:** Launched the Mining page with a high-density ledger and cost-modeling engine.
- **Tactical Component Hardening:**
    - **TacticalScrollBox:** Custom scroll component engineered for "EVE Dark" high-density tables.
    - **DataCooldownHUD 2.0:** Advanced telemetry timers and improved interaction logic for real-time ESI cache monitoring.
- **Market & Contracts Integration:** Full deployment of individual order tracking and contract ledger visualization.
- **Infrastructure Hardening:** Migrated Industry models to `BigInteger` for 64-bit identifier compatibility.

### [2026-01-20] Chapter 3: Global Framework & UI Doctrine 1.2

Focus shifted to the global user experience and regulatory governance.
- **Global Frame Integration:** Deployed persistent top and bottom tactical bars across all modules.
- **UI Doctrine Evolution:** Updated the UI Doctrine Standard to enforce pixel-perfect alignment and data density rules across the new info bar implementations.
- **Governance Refactor:** Optimized project roles and governance documents to better support the dual-agent (Gemini/Claude) development model.

### [2026-01-19] Chapter 2: The Tactical Landing & SDE Authority

A massive push toward visual fidelity and data authority.
- **SDE-First Data Standard:** Established the local SDE as the primary authority for static data, eliminating reliance on volatile ESI lookups for items and stations.
- **Tactical Landing Experience:** Redesigned Login and Callback pages with rotating orbital rings, CRT scanlines, and the **Neural Ticker** (200+ lore-accurate phrases).
- **Structure Resolution Fallbacks:** Implemented robust multi-stage resolution logic (SDE -> Asset Names -> Structure Info) to resolve "Unknown Location" errors.
- **Financial Module Optimization:**
    - **Gap-Filling Logic:** Engineered cross-stack "Bridge" logic for real-time telemetry anchoring.
    - **Numerical Law Enforcement:** Enforced strict ISK formatting and tactical exceptions.
- **Wallet & Journal Refinement:** Unified the Wallet UI, modularized asset/journal fetching, and implemented detailed market transaction history.
- **Platform Hardening:** Migrated to FastAPI core with SQLAlchemy 2.0 and monthly range partitioning for market history.

### [2026-01-19] Chapter 1: Authorization & Core Foundation

- **Project Genesis:** Initial authorization of the EVE Unified Intelligence Platform. Core architecture established with FastAPI (Backend) and React/Zustand (Frontend).
